abstractNote={The upper limb activity of twenty upper limb myoelectric prosthesis users and twenty anatomically intact adults were recorded over a 7-day period using two wrist worn accelerometers (Actigraph, LLC). This dataset reflects the real-world activities of the participants during their normal day-to-day routines. The dataset contains unprocessed raw accelerations and processed activity count data. A non-wear algorithm is also included for the removal of prosthesis non-wear periods as well as the self-reported wear diaries completed by the participants.},
